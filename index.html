            <p>Climate change is a concern for everyone including we at Ikea and we are doing our part to reduce the carbon footprint in the home with conscious, eco-friendly designed appliances and smart home devices. 
                With COP27 in mind we are proud to introduce our first ever eco-friendly passive air filter and Wi-Fi speaker.</p>
                
                <p>Our Rulle will filter out all matter of in-home, outdoor, and subterranean pollutants and particles. Operating at a max frequency of -24Db, it is particularly silent.</p>
            <p>With the built-in Wi-Fi speaker, it can fill a 3000 sq ft room with rich, beautiful sound up to a maximum of 48Db.</p>

            <p>The Rulle not only creates beautiful sound and clean air but can also improve the health of indoor plants with our one-of-a-kind wavelength photosynthesizer, making house plants grow more vibrant and abundant.</p> 
            <p>We are launching this incredible product at an unheard-of early bird price of $299 for the first 3 months of our product launch. Reservation pre-orders are open now.</p>
